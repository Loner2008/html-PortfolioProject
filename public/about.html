<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I see you're interested about me! My name is Mehrsa. I'm 15 years old and I'm... basically a weeb.╰(*°▽°*)╯ I'm biologically from Iran but I moved to Denmark about 2 years ago because of my parents' job and the fact that they never wanted me to live my future life in Iran. Yep... moving is hard. But it's even harder when you're a teenager.</p>

<p>About me being a weeb, I've been interested in Japanese anime as well as Japan as a country itself. A bit before that i've been very interested in kpop and kdrama. Though it isn't to the point of affecting my life that much... uh... maybe in some stuff but still...</p>

<p>I'm also a bit of a nerd. It's not really like I enjoy studying or programming but I'm pretty good at it so... people like to push me to doing it more and I kind of got used to it. So if you're about my age and ever need help with your studies, don't hesitate coming to me.</p>
